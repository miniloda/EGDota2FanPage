# EGDota2FanPage #EGForTI11


<h2 align='center'>Project</h2>
This project is a fan page of Evil Genius Dota 2. 
I made this project to showcase my skills. I love playing DOTA2 and my favorite team is Evil Geniuses. I was addicted to Dota 2 before but I stopped playing when I started going into web development. That is why I created this project to show my love for the game and for the team by building a fan page.
